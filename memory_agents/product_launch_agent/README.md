## How It Works 🔄

### 1. Product Intelligence Team (Multi-Agent System)

The application uses three specialized AI agents that coordinate to provide comprehensive competitive intelligence:

#### **Product Launch Analyst**
- Evaluates competitor positioning and Go-To-Market strategy
- Identifies launch tactics that drove success
- Pinpoints execution weaknesses and gaps
- Provides actionable strategic insights

#### **Market Sentiment Specialist**
- Analyzes social media sentiment (Twitter/X, Reddit, Product Hunt)
- Tracks customer reviews and feedback patterns
- Monitors brand perception across platforms
- Identifies positive and negative sentiment drivers

#### **Launch Metrics Specialist**
- Tracks user adoption and engagement metrics
- Analyzes press coverage and media attention
- Measures market penetration and growth rates
- Benchmarks performance against industry standards

### 2. Conversation Flow

**Step 1: Introduction**
- System asks about your company and product
- Stores your context for personalized analysis

**Step 2: Analysis Selection**
- Choose from three analysis types:
  1. Product Launch Analysis
  2. Market Sentiment Analysis
  3. Launch Metrics Analysis
- Specify the competitor you want to analyze

**Step 3: AI Research**
- Multi-agent system performs real-time web research using Bright Data
- Scrapes competitor websites, news, reviews, and social media
- Analyzes data and generates comprehensive report
- All findings stored in Memori for future reference

**Step 4: Follow-Up & Deep Dive**
- Ask follow-up questions about the analysis
- Request additional competitor analyses
- System searches Memori before answering for consistency
- All conversations tracked for context-aware responses

## Example Workflow 🔄

1. **Launch App**: Open the application and enter your API keys
2. **Introduce Product**: "I'm building a project management tool for remote teams"
3. **Request Analysis**: "I want a Product Launch Analysis for Monday.com"
4. **AI Research**: System scrapes web data and analyzes Monday.com's launch
5. **Review Report**: Receive detailed analysis with positioning, strengths, weaknesses, and insights
6. **Follow-Up**: Ask questions like "What were their main marketing channels?"
7. **Next Analysis**: Request analysis of another competitor or different analysis type
