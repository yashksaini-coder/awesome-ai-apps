# Lesson 6.2: Swarm Intelligence

The **Swarm Intelligence** pattern allows a group of agents to collaborate dynamically to solve complex problems. Unlike the "Agent as Tools" pattern, there is no central orchestrator. Instead, any agent can hand off the task to any other agent in the swarm based on their collective intelligence.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to create self-organizing agent swarms
- How to configure swarm parameters for optimal performance
- How agents make intelligent handoff decisions
- How to handle complex, open-ended problems with emergent behavior
- Best practices for swarm-based multi-agent systems

## 💡 Key Concepts

### 1. **Decentralized Collaboration**

No single agent controls the workflow. Each agent can decide which specialist should handle the next part of the task.

### 2. **Emergent Behavior**

The swarm's collective intelligence emerges from individual agent decisions, often leading to creative solutions.

### 3. **Dynamic Routing**

Agents intelligently route tasks based on their understanding of the problem and available specialists.

### 4. **Self-Organization**

The swarm automatically organizes itself based on task requirements without external orchestration.

## ⚙️ Configuration Parameters

### Core Parameters

- **`entry_point`**: Which agent starts the task
- **`max_handoffs`**: Maximum number of agent-to-agent handoffs
- **`max_iterations`**: Maximum iterations per agent
- **`execution_timeout`**: Total time limit for the entire swarm

### Safety Parameters

- **`node_timeout`**: Time limit per individual agent
- **`repetitive_handoff_detection_window`**: Window for detecting loops
- **`repetitive_handoff_min_unique_agents`**: Minimum unique agents to prevent loops

### Advanced Parameters

- **`handoff_prompt`**: Custom prompt for handoff decisions
- **`result_aggregation_strategy`**: How to combine results from multiple agents

## 🎯 Example Use Cases

### Software Development

**Task:** "Build a web application for managing customer orders"
**Process:**

1. Researcher → Discovers requirements and constraints
2. Architect → Designs system architecture and API structure
3. Coder → Implements the application code
4. Reviewer → Reviews code quality and suggests improvements
5. Tester → Validates functionality and edge cases

### Research and Analysis

**Task:** "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare and create a comprehensive report"
**Process:**

1. Researcher → Gathers data and identifies key trends
2. Analyst → Processes and analyzes the data
3. Writer → Creates structured report content
4. Reviewer → Ensures accuracy and completeness
5. Editor → Polishes the final report

### Creative Projects

**Task:** "Create a marketing campaign for a new product launch"
**Process:**

1. Researcher → Studies market and competitor analysis
2. Strategist → Develops campaign strategy
3. Creative → Designs visual and content elements
4. Copywriter → Creates compelling copy
5. Reviewer → Ensures brand consistency and effectiveness

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Handoff Logic

```python
# Custom handoff prompt for specific behavior
swarm = Swarm(
    agents=[researcher, architect, coder, reviewer],
    entry_point=researcher,
    handoff_prompt="""Based on the current task state, determine which specialist
    should continue. Consider the task complexity, required skills, and current progress."""
)
```

### Result Aggregation

```python
# Configure how results are combined
swarm = Swarm(
    agents=agents,
    result_aggregation_strategy="sequential",  # or "parallel", "hierarchical"
    # ... other parameters
)
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. **Agent Design**

- **Clear Specializations**: Each agent should have a distinct, well-defined role
- **Complementary Skills**: Agents should have overlapping but distinct capabilities
- **Consistent Interfaces**: All agents should follow similar interaction patterns

### 2. **Swarm Configuration**

- **Start Simple**: Begin with fewer agents and add complexity gradually
- **Monitor Performance**: Track handoff patterns and execution times
- **Set Reasonable Limits**: Prevent infinite loops and excessive costs

### 3. **Task Design**

- **Open-Ended Problems**: Swarms excel at complex, exploratory tasks
- **Clear Objectives**: Provide clear success criteria for the swarm
- **Appropriate Scope**: Balance complexity with execution time

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### 1. **Infinite Loops**

- **Problem**: Agents keep handing off to each other without progress
- **Solution**: Set appropriate `repetitive_handoff_detection_window` and limits

### 2. **Poor Agent Specialization**

- **Problem**: Agents have overlapping or unclear responsibilities
- **Solution**: Define clear, distinct roles for each agent

### 3. **Inadequate Timeouts**

- **Problem**: Swarm gets stuck on difficult tasks
- **Solution**: Set appropriate timeouts and iteration limits

### 4. **Unclear Task Objectives**

- **Problem**: Swarm doesn't know when to stop or what success looks like
- **Solution**: Provide clear, measurable objectives

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Swarm Gets Stuck

- Check agent system prompts for clarity
- Verify that agents can make meaningful progress
- Consider reducing task complexity
- Review handoff detection parameters

### Poor Handoff Decisions

- Improve agent system prompts with handoff guidance
- Add more context about other agents' capabilities
- Consider custom handoff prompts

### Performance Issues

- Monitor token usage and costs
- Optimize agent system prompts for efficiency
- Consider using different models for different agents
- Implement result caching where appropriate

## 📊 Monitoring and Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("strands.multiagent").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Track Execution Path

```python
result = swarm("Your task here")
print(f"Execution path: {[node.node_id for node in result.node_history]}")
print(f"Handoff reasons: {[node.handoff_reason for node in result.node_history]}")
```

### Monitor Performance

- Track execution time per agent
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Analyze handoff patterns for optimization
