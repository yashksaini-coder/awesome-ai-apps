# Lesson 6: Advanced Multi-Agent Patterns

Welcome to the final and most advanced lesson in the AWS Strands course! Here, you'll move beyond single agents and explore powerful patterns for building complex systems where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a goal.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Design and implement hierarchical agent systems with clear delegation patterns
- Build dynamic, self-organizing agent swarms for complex problem-solving
- Create structured, predictable workflows using graph-based patterns
- Choose the right multi-agent pattern for different use cases
- Understand the trade-offs between different multi-agent approaches

## 🏗️ Multi-Agent Patterns Overview

Strands provides high-level abstractions for orchestrating multi-agent workflows. We'll cover four key patterns, each with distinct advantages:

### 1. **Agent as Tools** 🛠️

A hierarchical pattern where a "manager" agent delegates tasks to specialized "worker" agents.

- **Best for**: Clear task decomposition, centralized control
- **Use cases**: Customer service, content creation, research workflows
- **Advantages**: Predictable, easy to debug, clear responsibility boundaries

### 2. **Swarm Intelligence** 🐝

A dynamic and decentralized pattern where agents can intelligently hand off tasks to each other.

- **Best for**: Open-ended problems, creative tasks, exploration
- **Use cases**: Software development, research, creative writing
- **Advantages**: Flexible, emergent behavior, self-organizing

### 3. **Graph-Based Workflows** 📊

A structured pattern where you define a predictable, directed workflow for your agents.

- **Best for**: Production systems, repeatable processes, compliance
- **Use cases**: Data pipelines, approval workflows, quality assurance
- **Advantages**: Reliable, auditable, parallel execution

### 4. **Workflow Agent** 🔄

The most advanced pattern combining stateful workflows with conditional logic.

- **Best for**: Complex business processes, adaptive systems
- **Use cases**: Customer onboarding, dynamic content generation
- **Advantages**: Stateful, conditional, highly flexible

## 📚 Sub-Lessons
